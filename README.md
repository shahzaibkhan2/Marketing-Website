# The Google Gemini Clone Developed with React + Vite

I Built a fully functional, responsive and beautiful Google Gemini Clone using JavaScript, HTML and CSS, Git 
and Github, Redux, ECMA Script on ReactJs. I fetched the Google Gemini API using advanced JavaScript 
async await methods. This website is available on my Github ID. I have also hosted this website on Vercel 
at this address https://shahzaib-gemini-clone.vercel.app to make it available to the public.

Currently, available on:
